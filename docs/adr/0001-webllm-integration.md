# ADR 0001: WebLLM Integration

## Status

Superseded

## Context

We are integrating WebLLM into our application to provide AI-driven thought expansion features. The goal is to analyze user input and generate thought-provoking questions to enhance the user's thinking process.

## Key Decisions

1. **Use WebLLM for Privacy**
   - **Reason**: WebLLM allows client-side AI inference, ensuring that no data leaves the user's device, aligning with our privacy goals.

2. **Run WebLLM in a Web Worker for Performance**
   - **Reason**: Offloading AI processing to a web worker improves application performance by keeping the main thread responsive.

3. **Implement Web Worker with TypeScript and Transpile for Production with Vite**
   - **Reason**: TypeScript provides type safety and a better development experience, while Vite's built-in capabilities allow seamless transpilation to JavaScript for production builds.

4. **Progressive Model Loading**
   - **Reason**: Provides user feedback during model loading, improving user experience.
   - **Impact**: Users see a progress bar indicating model loading status.

5. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - **Reason**: Ensure application resilience in case of AI failures.
   - **Impact**: Graceful degradation with fallback questions if AI generation fails.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Enhanced user experience with AI-driven features, privacy compliance, and cost savings.
- **Negative**: Initial model loading time may affect first-time user experience.

## Related Decisions

- None
