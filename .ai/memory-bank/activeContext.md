## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Minimal Viable Feature Complete

The project has reached a major milestone. The core functionalityâ€”a thought-expanding editor powered by a client-side LLMâ€”is now implemented and working.

### Completed Feature: Client-Side LLM Integration âœ…

- âœ… **Architecture**: Successfully implemented a full client-side AI architecture using WebLLM running in a Web Worker. This ensures user privacy and removes the need for a server-side AI backend.
- âœ… **UI Components**: The `QuillEditor` and `SimpleQuestionDisplay` components are fully integrated. The data flow from user input to AI-generated question is complete.
- âœ… **User Experience**: The UI now includes a detailed progress indicator for model loading. The AI correctly detects the input language and responds in kind.
- âœ… **Code Quality**: Refactored the UI components to centralize state management in the main route, improving clarity and maintainability. Simplified the AI interaction to use a single-question format, removing complex parsing logic.

## Recent Changes

### WebLLM Implementation (Current Session)
- **Technology**: Integrated `@mlc-ai/web-llm` for in-browser inference.
- **Worker**: Created a TypeScript-based worker (`webllm-worker.ts`) to handle all LLM operations.
- **Vite Config**: Updated `vite.config.ts` to correctly handle worker transpilation using the `new URL(...)` pattern.
- **Domain**: Established a clear `ai` domain with a `WebLLMClient` to abstract worker communication.
- **UI**: Implemented model loading progress (percentage, MB loaded, elapsed time) and connected the AI response to the display component.

### Memory Bank Updates
- Updated `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to reflect the completion of the minimal viable LLM feature.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Continue)

1.  **Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the `WebLLMClient`.
    - [ ] Write component tests for `SimpleQuestionDisplay`.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the full editor-to-AI-response flow.
2.  **Code Cleanup & Refinement**
    - [ ] Review the current implementation for any potential refactoring opportunities.
    - [ ] Ensure all code adheres to the established project style guides.
3.  **Explore Future Features**
    - [ ] Begin planning for features listed in `projectbrief.md`, such as thought history or customizable questions.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1.  **AI Integration Strategy**: WebLLM for client-side inference.
    - **Reasoning**: Prioritizes user privacy and eliminates server costs and complexity.
2.  **Architecture**: Web Worker for AI processing.
    - **Reasoning**: Prevents blocking the main UI thread during model loading and inference, ensuring a smooth user experience.
3.  **Language Handling**: Delegated to the LLM.
    - **Reasoning**: A simple and elegant solution that avoids adding a separate language-detection library.
4.  **State Management**: Centralized state in the main route component.
    - **Reasoning**: Solved data synchronization issues and created a clear, unidirectional data flow.

### Open Questions

1.  **Error Handling**: How can we make error handling more robust? (e.g., if the model fails to generate a valid question).
2.  **Model Selection**: Should we allow users to select different models? What are the UX and technical implications?
3.  **Persistence**: Now that the core feature is working, should we revisit the decision for no data persistence? What are the privacy trade-offs?

### Current Constraints

- The application is now dependent on browser support for WebGPU and Web Workers.
- Initial model load time can still be significant depending on the user's network and device.
