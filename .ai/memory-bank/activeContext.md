# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Initialization Phase

The project is currently in the **initialization phase**. The memory bank has been established with the core documentation structure, and we're ready to begin the actual implementation.

### Current Priority: Memory Bank Initialization ✅

- ✅ **Completed**: Created all required memory bank files
  - `projectbrief.md` - Core project requirements and goals
  - `productContext.md` - Why the project exists and how it should work
  - `systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and technical decisions
  - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development setup
  - `activeContext.md` - Current work focus and next steps
  - `progress.md` - What works and what's left to build

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Structure (Current Session)
- Established complete memory bank documentation
- Defined clear project scope and technical approach
- Documented system architecture and design patterns
- Specified technology stack and development constraints

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Begin)

1. **Project Setup Phase**
   - Initialize the React Router v7 project with Vite
   - Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Install and configure core dependencies
   - Establish project structure following DDD patterns

2. **Domain Object Creation** (Operator Task)
   - Create domain objects for editor content and AI interactions
   - Define models, factories, and repositories
   - Set up database schema if persistence is needed

3. **Service Implementation Planning**
   - Plan service functions for content analysis
   - Design AI integration services
   - Create comprehensive test strategy

### Development Stages (Following Rules)

According to the development process defined in the rules:

1. **Object Creation Stage** (Next)
   - Operator creates domain objects
   - Implement Factories and Repositories
   - Operator review and approval

2. **Service Implementation Stage**
   - Plan service functions
   - Write ADR for key decisions
   - Implement and test services
   - Operator review and approval

3. **Application Implementation Stage**
   - Plan pages and components
   - Write ADR for UI decisions
   - Implement UI components
   - Operator review and approval

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Editor Technology**: TipTap (Prosemirror-based)
   - Rich WYSIWYG capabilities
   - Good React integration
   - Extensible for future features

2. **Input Monitoring**: Debounced approach with 5-second delay
   - Prevents excessive API calls
   - Balances responsiveness with performance

3. **LLM Integration**: Server-side API approach
   - Better security for API keys
   - Consistent response formatting
   - Easier rate limiting and monitoring

4. **State Management**: React state with custom hooks
   - Simple state requirements
   - No complex global state needed

### Open Questions

1. **Persistence Strategy**
   - Should user content be persisted locally?
   - What about thought history and session management?
   - Privacy considerations for sensitive content

2. **AI Provider Selection**
   - OpenAI API vs WebLLM for local inference
   - Cost considerations vs privacy benefits
   - Fallback strategies for API failures

3. **Question Framework Implementation**
   - Which thinking frameworks to prioritize?
   - How to structure prompts for consistent results?
   - Quality control for generated questions

### Current Constraints

1. **Development Environment**
   - Need to set up complete development environment
   - Establish coding standards and linting rules
   - Configure testing framework

2. **API Integration**
   - Need OpenAI API key for development
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Error handling strategies

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - 3-second response time target
   - Efficient handling of large text content
   - Optimized bundle size

## Work Context

### Current Session Focus
- Memory bank initialization completed
- Ready to begin actual project implementation
- Following established development process and rules

### Key Principles to Follow
- Domain-driven design approach
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Operator review at each stage

### Success Criteria
- All memory bank files properly established ✅
- Clear development path defined
- Ready to begin implementation phase
