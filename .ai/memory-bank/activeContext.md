# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Implementation Phase - UI Components

The project has moved from initialization to **implementation phase**. We have successfully implemented the core WYSIWYG editor component using Quill and established proper CSS organization patterns.

### Current Priority: Quill Editor Implementation âœ…

- âœ… **Completed**: Implemented Quill editor component with proper CSS organization
  - Created `QuillEditor.client.tsx` with bubble theme (no toolbar)
  - Established `QuillEditor.css` for global styles (headings, lists, base styles)
  - Maintained `QuillEditor.module.css` for layout/container styles
  - Added heading support (H1-H4) with proper styling
  - Configured idle detection and content change callbacks
  - Documented critical CSS organization pattern in notes.md

## Recent Changes

### Quill Editor Implementation (Current Session)
- **Component Structure**: 
  - `QuillEditor.client.tsx` - Main component with Quill integration
  - `QuillEditor.css` - Global styles for `.ql-editor` elements
  - `QuillEditor.module.css` - Scoped styles for container layout
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Bubble theme (toolbar-free interface)
  - Heading support (H1-H4) with proper styling
  - List support with configurable indentation
  - Idle detection (5-second timeout)
  - Content change callbacks
  - Responsive design
- **CSS Organization Pattern**: Established critical rule for Quill editor CSS organization

### Memory Bank Updates
- Updated `.ai/notes.md` with Quill editor CSS organization pattern
- Documented the requirement for dedicated CSS files for Quill components
- Established clear separation between global styles and CSS module styles

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Continue)

1. **Complete Editor Integration**
   - Integrate QuillEditor into main application routes
   - Set up content state management
   - Implement AI question display component

2. **AI Integration Setup**
   - Create AI service for question generation
   - Implement prompt engineering for thought expansion
   - Set up API communication layer

3. **Question Display Component**
   - Design and implement question display UI
   - Create loading states and error handling
   - Integrate with editor idle detection

### Development Stages (Following Rules)

According to the development process defined in the rules:

1. **Object Creation Stage** (May be needed)
   - Create domain objects for editor content and AI interactions
   - Define models, factories, and repositories
   - Set up database schema if persistence is needed

2. **Service Implementation Stage** (Next Priority)
   - Plan AI integration services
   - Design question generation logic
   - Create comprehensive test strategy

3. **Application Implementation Stage** (In Progress)
   - Continue UI component development
   - Integrate components into routes
   - Implement complete user flow

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Editor Technology**: Quill (instead of TipTap)
   - Rich WYSIWYG capabilities with bubble theme
   - Good React integration
   - Simpler implementation for current needs

2. **CSS Organization**: Dedicated CSS file pattern
   - Global styles for Quill elements in separate `.css` file
   - Layout styles in CSS modules
   - Direct import pattern for global styles

3. **Input Monitoring**: Debounced approach with 5-second delay
   - Prevents excessive API calls
   - Balances responsiveness with performance

4. **Theme Selection**: Bubble theme for distraction-free writing
   - No toolbar for clean interface
   - Keyboard shortcuts for formatting
   - Focus on content creation

### Open Questions

1. **AI Integration Strategy**
   - OpenAI API vs WebLLM for local inference
   - Cost considerations vs privacy benefits
   - Fallback strategies for API failures

2. **Question Framework Implementation**
   - Which thinking frameworks to prioritize?
   - How to structure prompts for consistent results?
   - Quality control for generated questions

3. **State Management**
   - How to manage editor content state?
   - Question history and display state?
   - Session persistence considerations

### Current Constraints

1. **Development Environment**
   - Project structure established
   - Quill editor component implemented
   - Ready for AI integration

2. **API Integration**
   - Need OpenAI API key for development
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Error handling strategies

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - 3-second response time target
   - Efficient handling of large text content
   - Optimized bundle size

## Work Context

### Current Session Focus
- Quill editor implementation completed
- CSS organization pattern established
- Ready to continue with AI integration and question display

### Key Principles to Follow
- Domain-driven design approach
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Operator review at each stage
- Follow established CSS organization patterns

### Success Criteria
- âœ… Quill editor component implemented with proper styling
- âœ… CSS organization pattern documented
- ðŸš§ AI integration and question display (next)
- ðŸš§ Complete user flow implementation
