## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Core Feature Implementation Complete

The project has successfully pivoted to a multi-provider "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model. The core features, including API key management, question generation, and question history management (including clearing history), are now fully implemented.

The current focus is on testing, polishing the user experience, and addressing potential challenges around API differences and error handling.

## Recent Changes

### Core Feature Implementation (Completed)
- **BYOK Architecture**: Implemented the full client-side BYOK flow.
- **Resource Routes**: Created resource routes for handling LLM configuration and question-related actions (`/llm-config`, `/question`).
- **Question History**: Implemented question generation (`POST /question`) and clearing (`DELETE /question`).
- **UI Components**: Built `LlmConfigurer` and integrated it into the main page.
- **State Management**: Solidified the use of `clientLoader` and `useFetcher` for all client-side data management.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Testing & Polish)

1.  **Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the `AIFactory` and each `LLMClient`.
    - [ ] Write integration tests covering the full user flow:
        - Configuring an API key.
        - Generating a question.
        - Clearing the question history.
2.  **UX Polish**
    - [ ] Implement robust and user-friendly error handling for API calls.
    - [ ] Refine loading states to provide better feedback to the user.
3.  **Feature Enhancement**
    - [ ] Allow users to select specific models from a provider (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1.  **AI Integration Strategy**: Multi-Provider "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK).
    - **Reasoning**: Maximizes model quality and user flexibility while ensuring privacy.
2.  **Architecture**: Direct client-to-provider API calls using Resource Routes.
    - **Reasoning**: Avoids server infrastructure costs and provides a clean separation of concerns.
3.  **Data Management**: Remix `clientLoader`/`clientAction` with `localStorage`.
    - **Reasoning**: Aligns with framework best practices for robust client-side state.
4.  **Form Submissions**: `useFetcher` for all form interactions.
    - **Reasoning**: Provides a seamless UX without full page navigations.

### Open Questions

1.  **Unified Error Handling**: What is the best strategy to normalize and display errors from different provider APIs (e.g., invalid key, rate limits, model errors) in a consistent UI?
2.  **Model Selection UI**: How should the UI be designed to allow users to select models within a provider without cluttering the interface?
3.  **Key Encryption**: Should we add an optional layer of client-side encryption for API keys stored in `localStorage` for enhanced security?
