## Known Issues

### No Current Issues
- Quill editor component working correctly
- CSS organization pattern established and documented
- No technical debt or bugs in current implementation

### Current Challenges (Identified)
1. **Editor Height Management**
   - **Issue**: Editor height expands to fit content instead of being constrained to parent element height
   - **Current Setup**: Uses `height: 100%` which makes it grow with content beyond parent bounds
   - **Need**: Editor should be fixed to parent element height and scroll internally when content exceeds available space
   - **Impact**: Affects layout consistency and user experience
   - **Solution Required**: Ensure editor respects parent container height while maintaining internal scrollability

### Potential Challenges (Identified)
1. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - Prompt engineering for consistent results
   - Rate limiting and cost management
   - Error handling for API failures

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - 3-second response time target
   - Efficient handling of large text content
   - Optimized bundle size

3. **User Experience**
   - Balancing AI assistance with natural writing flow
   - Preventing interruption of user's thinking process
   - Ensuring questions are genuinely helpful

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - AI service integration with Quill editor
   - Question display component design
   - State management for editor and questions

5. **Styling and Height Challenge**
   - Modern styling with rounded corners and consistent theming
   - Handling height constraints in the editor
