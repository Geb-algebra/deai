# Progress

## What Works

### ✅ BYOK Foundation & Core Features
- **Multi-Provider BYOK**: The core architecture for supporting multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) is in place.
- **API Key Management**: Users can securely provide and manage their API keys, which are stored in `localStorage`.
- **Quill Editor**: A functional `QuillEditor.client.tsx` component is integrated for rich text input.
- **AI Question Generation**: The system successfully generates questions based on user input after a period of idle time.
- **Question History**: Generated questions are stored and displayed.
- **Clear History**: Users can clear the question history.

### ✅ Project Foundation
- Complete project documentation structure established.
- Core project setup with Vite, React, and TypeScript is in place.
- Development process, rules, and architectural patterns are documented in the memory bank.
- The decision to pivot to a BYOK model has been made and documented in ADRs.

## What's Deprecated

### ❌ Client-Side AI Integration (WebLLM)
- The entire WebLLM-based implementation has been removed from the codebase.

## What's Left to Build

### 🚧 Phase 1: Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all AI clients and the factory.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the full BYOK flow.

### 🚧 Phase 2: Polish & UX Enhancements
- [ ] Unified error handling for API differences.
- [ ] UI State Management improvements for loading/error states.
- [ ] Add ability for user to select specific model from a provider (e.g. GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5).

### 🚧 Phase 3: Deployment
- [ ] Production build configuration.
- [ ] Deployment setup.
- [ ] Final documentation updates.

## Current Status

### Project Phase: Implementation - Core Features Complete ✅
- **Status**: Moving to Testing & Polish
- **Progress**: 80%
- **Next Phase**: Testing

### Key Milestones
1. ✅ **Project Pivot & Planning** - Complete
2. ✅ **BYOK Foundation** - Complete
3. ✅ **Provider Implementation** - Complete
4. ✅ **UI and Integration** - Complete
5. 🚧 **Cleanup & Testing** - In Progress
6. 🚧 **Deployment & Polish** - Not started

## Known Issues

### Potential Challenges (Identified)
1. **API Differences**: Handling variations in request/response formats, streaming protocols, and error handling across three different SDKs.
2. **Unified Error Handling**: Creating a consistent way to display errors from different providers to the user.
3. **UI State Management**: Managing the states for different providers, their keys, and loading/error states in a clean way.
