# Progress

## What Works

### ✅ Memory Bank & Project Foundation
- Complete project documentation structure established.
- Core project setup with Vite, React, and TypeScript is in place.
- Development process, rules, and architectural patterns are documented.
- The decision to pivot to a BYOK model has been made and documented in ADRs.

### ✅ Core UI Components
- **Quill Editor**: A functional `QuillEditor.client.tsx` component exists.
- **Display Area**: A `SimpleQuestionDisplay.tsx` component exists for showing AI output.

## What's Deprecated (Previously Completed)

### ❌ Client-Side AI Integration (WebLLM)
- The entire WebLLM-based implementation, including the web worker, client, and progress tracking, is now deprecated due to performance and quality limitations. This work will be removed from the codebase.

## What's Left to Build

### 🚧 Phase 1: BYOK Foundation (Not Started)
- [ ] Install SDKs: `openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@google/generative-ai`.
- [ ] Define common AI domain models (`LLMClient`) in `app/domains/ai/models.ts`.
- [ ] Implement `clientLoader` and `clientAction` in `app/routes/_index.tsx` for `localStorage` key management.

### 🚧 Phase 2: Provider Implementation (Not Started)
- [ ] Implement `OpenAIClient`.
- [ ] Implement `ClaudeClient`.
- [ ] Implement `GeminiClient`.
- [ ] Implement the `AIFactory` to select the correct client.

### 🚧 Phase 3: UI and Integration (Not Started)
- [ ] Build the `ApiKeyModal` with `useFetcher`.
- [ ] Add a provider selection UI to the main page.
- [ ] Integrate the main page with `clientLoader` data.
- [ ] Trigger the AI generation flow on user idle.
- [ ] Stream the response to the `SimpleQuestionDisplay` component.

### 🚧 Phase 4: Cleanup & Testing (Not Started)
- [ ] Remove all deprecated WebLLM files and dependencies.
- [ ] Write unit tests for all new clients and the factory.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the full BYOK flow.

### 🚧 Phase 5: Deployment & Polish (Not Started)
- [ ] Production build configuration.
- [ ] Deployment setup.
- [ ] Final documentation updates.

## Current Status

### Project Phase: Implementation - BYOK Foundation 🚧
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Progress**: 0%
- **Next Phase**: Provider Implementation

### Key Milestones
1. ✅ **Project Pivot & Planning** - Complete
2. 🚧 **BYOK Foundation** - Not Started
3. 🚧 **Provider Implementation** - Not Started
4. 🚧 **UI and Integration** - Not Started
5. 🚧 **Cleanup & Testing** - Not Started
6. 🚧 **Deployment & Polish** - Not started

## Known Issues

### No Current Implementation Issues
- The previous implementation has been deprecated. We are starting from a clean slate regarding the AI backend.

### Potential Challenges (Identified)
1. **API Differences**: Handling variations in request/response formats, streaming protocols, and error handling across three different SDKs.
2. **Unified Error Handling**: Creating a consistent way to display errors from different providers to the user.
3. **UI State Management**: Managing the states for different providers, their keys, and loading/error states in a clean way.

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] Bundle size < 500KB
- [ ] Response time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Zero critical bugs

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Users can write naturally without interruption
- [ ] AI questions appear within 5 seconds of inactivity
- [ ] Questions are relevant and helpful
- [ ] Interface is intuitive and accessible
- [ ] No data loss or corruption

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security best practices

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Ready to Continue)
1. **AI Integration**
