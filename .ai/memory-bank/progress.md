# Progress

## What Works

### âœ… Memory Bank Documentation
- Complete project documentation established
- Clear technical specifications defined
- Development process and rules documented
- Ready for implementation phase

### âœ… Project Planning
- System architecture designed
- Technology stack selected
- Component structure planned
- Development stages defined

### âœ… Quill Editor Implementation
- **Component Structure**: Complete Quill editor component implemented
  - `QuillEditor.client.tsx` - Main component with Quill integration
  - `QuillEditor.css` - Global styles for `.ql-editor` elements
  - `QuillEditor.module.css` - Scoped styles for container layout
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Bubble theme (toolbar-free interface)
  - Heading support (H1-H4) with proper styling
  - List support with configurable indentation
  - Idle detection (5-second timeout)
  - Content change callbacks
  - Responsive design
  - Design system integration (CSS custom properties)
  - Modern styling with rounded corners and consistent theming
- **CSS Organization**: Established critical pattern for Quill editor CSS organization

### âœ… Client-Side AI Integration (WebLLM)
- **Web Worker**: Implemented a TypeScript-based Web Worker to run the WebLLM engine, preventing UI blocking.
- **Vite Configuration**: Configured Vite to correctly transpile and bundle the TypeScript worker for production.
- **Progress Tracking**: Added a progress indicator for model loading, showing percentage, downloaded MB, and elapsed time.
- **Dynamic Prompting**: The LLM prompt is now engineered to detect the user's language and respond in kind.
- **Simplified Response**: The AI now provides a single, direct question, removing the need for complex client-side parsing.

## What's Left to Build

- âœ… Implement factories for all domain objects
- âœ… Implement client for worker communication (`WebLLMClient`)

### ðŸš§ Phase 3: Core Services (Complete)
- âœ… Content analysis services (handled by LLM)
- âœ… AI integration services (WebLLM client and worker)
- âœ… Question generation services (handled by LLM)

### ðŸš§ Phase 4: UI Components (Complete)
- âœ… WYSIWYG Editor component
- âœ… Question Display component
- âœ… Main page layout with component composition

### ðŸš§ Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Partially Complete)

## Known Issues

### No Current Issues
- Quill editor component working correctly
- CSS organization pattern established and documented
- Client-side AI feature is implemented and functional.
- The data flow between the editor, worker, and display components is working correctly.

### Current Challenges (Identified)
1. **Editor Height Management**
   - **Issue**: Editor height expands to fit content instead of being constrained to parent element height
   - **Current Setup**: Uses `height: 100%` which makes it grow with content beyond parent bounds
   - **Need**: Editor should be fixed to parent element height and scroll internally when content exceeds available space
   - **Impact**: Affects layout consistency and user experience
   - **Solution Required**: Ensure editor respects parent container height while maintaining internal scrollability

### Potential Challenges (Identified)
1. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - Prompt engineering for consistent results
   - Rate limiting and cost management
   - Error handling for API failures

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - 3-second response time target
   - Efficient handling of large text content
   - Optimized bundle size

3. **User Experience**
   - Balancing AI assistance with natural writing flow
   - Preventing interruption of user's thinking process
   - Ensuring questions are genuinely helpful

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - AI service integration with Quill editor
   - Question display component design
   - State management for editor and questions

5. **Styling and Height Challenge**
   - Modern styling with rounded corners and consistent theming
   - Handling height constraints in the editor
