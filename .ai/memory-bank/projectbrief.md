# ðŸ§  Thought-Expanding AI Assist Editor - Functional Specification

## 1. Overview

This application allows users to freely write their thoughts in a WYSIWYG editor.
When the user stops typing for 3 seconds, a user-configured AI (LLM) analyzes the content and returns
thought-provoking questions to help the user expand and deepen their thinking.
The system supports iterative thinking by continuously offering these questions.

## 2. Use Case Flow

1. The user configures their preferred LLM provider and API key.
2. The user writes freely in a WYSIWYG editor (typically in bullet-point style)
3. If there is no input for more than 3 seconds, the system sends the editor content to the configured LLM.
4. The LLM analyzes the content, identifies missing aspects or blind spots, and generates a question.
5. The system displays the generated question on screen.
6. The user can clear the history of generated questions at any time.
7. This loop continues until the user stops.
