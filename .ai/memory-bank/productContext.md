# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Thought-Expanding AI Assist Editor addresses a fundamental gap in digital thinking tools. While many note-taking and writing applications exist, they lack intelligent assistance that actively helps users expand and deepen their thinking process.

### Problems It Solves

1. **Cognitive Blind Spots**: Users often get stuck in their own thought patterns and miss important angles or considerations
2. **Shallow Thinking**: Without external prompts, users may not explore topics deeply enough
3. **Isolated Thinking**: Traditional editors don't provide the collaborative questioning that happens in good conversations
4. **Inconsistent Quality**: The depth of thinking varies greatly depending on the user's current mental state

### Target Users

- **Creative Professionals**: Writers, designers, strategists who need to explore ideas thoroughly
- **Researchers & Students**: Academic work requiring comprehensive analysis
- **Planners & Analysts**: Business and project planning that benefits from systematic thinking
- **Anyone Who "Thinks by Writing"**: People who process thoughts through the act of writing

## How It Should Work

### Core Experience Flow

1. **Free Writing Phase**: User writes thoughts naturally in a distraction-free WYSIWYG editor
2. **AI Analysis**: After 3 seconds of inactivity, AI analyzes the content for gaps and blind spots
3. **Question Generation**: AI generates a thought-provoking question
4. **Iterative Deepening**: User responds to questions, triggering new analysis cycles
5. **Continuous Expansion**: Process continues until user decides to stop

### Key Principles

- **Non-Intrusive**: AI assistance only activates when user stops typing
- **Framework-Based**: Questions use proven thinking frameworks (5W1H, SCAMPER, causality, prioritization)
- **Iterative**: Each cycle builds on previous thinking
- **Distraction-Free**: Clean interface that doesn't interrupt the thinking flow

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Deeper Thinking**: Help users explore topics more thoroughly than they would alone
2. **Systematic Analysis**: Ensure no important angles are missed through framework-based questioning
3. **Natural Flow**: Maintain the natural rhythm of thinking and writing
4. **Confidence Building**: Help users feel more confident in their thinking process

### Secondary Goals

1. **Learning**: Users learn better thinking patterns through exposure to systematic frameworks
2. **Efficiency**: Reduce time spent on shallow thinking or missing important considerations
3. **Quality**: Improve the overall quality and depth of written thoughts
4. **Accessibility**: Make advanced thinking techniques available to everyone

### Success Metrics

- Users explore topics more thoroughly than with traditional editors
- Users report feeling more confident in their thinking process
- Users discover new angles they wouldn't have considered alone
- Users find the tool helpful for complex problem-solving and planning
