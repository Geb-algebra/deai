# Project Intelligence Notes

## Memory Bank Initialization (Current Session)

### Key Insights from Setup

1. **Documentation-Driven Development**
   - The memory bank structure provides excellent clarity for project direction
   - Each file serves a specific purpose in the development hierarchy
   - The documentation-first approach prevents scope creep and ensures consistency

2. **Domain-Driven Design Integration**
   - The project naturally fits DDD patterns with clear editor and AI domains
   - Separation of concerns is well-defined from the start
   - Factory and Repository patterns will be crucial for maintainability

3. **Technology Stack Rationale**
   - TipTap chosen for its Prosemirror foundation and React integration
   - React Router v7 provides modern routing with server-side capabilities
   - Hono server offers lightweight, performant API endpoints

### Project-Specific Patterns Identified

1. **AI Integration Pattern**
   - Server-side API approach for security and consistency
   - Debounced input monitoring to balance responsiveness and performance
   - Framework-based questioning for systematic thinking expansion

2. **User Experience Considerations**
   - Non-intrusive AI assistance that doesn't interrupt natural writing flow
   - 5-second inactivity trigger balances responsiveness with user experience
   - Clean, distraction-free interface for focused thinking

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - 3-second response time target for AI questions
   - Efficient handling of large text content
   - Optimized bundle size for fast loading

### Development Process Insights

1. **Staged Development Approach**
   - Clear separation between object creation, service implementation, and UI development
   - Operator review at each stage ensures quality and alignment
   - ADR documentation for key architectural decisions

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive unit testing for all services
   - Component testing for UI elements
   - Integration testing for end-to-end functionality

### Technical Decisions Documented

1. **Editor Technology**: TipTap for rich WYSIWYG capabilities
2. **State Management**: React state with custom hooks for simplicity
3. **Styling Approach**: Tailwind for styling, CSS Modules for layout
4. **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Next Steps Clarity

The memory bank provides clear direction for:
- Project foundation setup
- Domain object creation (operator task)
- Service implementation planning
- UI component development

### Quality Assurance Approach

- Comprehensive documentation ensures consistent development
- Clear success metrics defined for each phase
- Performance and accessibility requirements established
- Security considerations documented from the start
